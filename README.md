This image was actually taken from a real estate website, so that's pretty appropriate for this problem set.

## Domain
The domain for this dataset originates from the Ames Assessor's Office to assess the values of individual property prices sold from 2006-2010. 
he data set contains 2930 observations and a large number of explanatory
variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) involved in assessing home
values. 

## Problem
This problem is a regression type of supervised learning.
We will also approach this problem as an unsupervised clustering problem to see if we can identify different groups of housing. 

## Solution
We will approach this task using Recursive Feature Elimination to identity the 10 most important features. Then we will subsequently perform a PCA those identified features.
